Excited to share my latest Power BI Dashboard project! This dynamic dashboard provides insightful visualizations on healthcare trends. A line chart tracks health metrics over time, while total patient counts and gender distribution are depicted through bar graphs. An area graph illustrates health trends by gender and condition, offering comprehensive insights. Additionally, a bar graph breaks down overweight counts by age group, highlighting crucial demographic patterns. Lastly, a scattered bar graph displays total patients by race and health status. This comprehensive dashboard offers valuable insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers alike, facilitating informed decision-making and improved patient care. #HealthcareAnalytics #PowerBI #DataVisualization
